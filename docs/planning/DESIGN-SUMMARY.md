# YAML Launcher Design Summary: Unified Framework with Backward Compatibility

**Date:** May 25, 2026  
**Status:** Design baseline; Phase 1 foundation implemented, later phases remain planned  
**Audience:** Architecture Review, Development Teams

---

## Problem Statement

Three codebases (test-framework, nb, ntools-launcher) independently solve similar problems:
- **test-framework:** Metadata-driven execution with output capture, assertions, variable extraction
- **nb:** Currently uses JSON manifests for app installation with verification (will migrate to YAML)
- **ntools-launcher:** Process orchestration with signature verification

**Current State:** 
- Each has its own approach to orchestration
- test-framework's output assertions/variable extraction not available in nb or ntools-launcher
- No unified way to describe multi-step deployments across repositories
- Duplicated logic for assertion validation, error handling, result passing

**Goal:** Create unified YAML-based launcher that:
1. Supports all existing functionality from three codebases
2. Adds new capabilities (parallel execution, output assertions, variable passing)
3. Maintains 100% backward compatibility
4. Enables cross-repository orchestration

```

### Backward Compatibility Strategy

#### Level 1: Schema Backward Compatibility
- **Old Code:** All existing YAML configs continue to work unchanged
- **New Code:** Can use optional new properties (assertions, extractVariables, expectedReturnCode)
- **Parser:** Handles both old and new YAML seamlessly

#### Level 2: API Backward Compatibility
- **Existing API:** Current `Launcher.LockVerifyStart()`, `LockStart()`, `Start()` methods remain unchanged
  - All public method signatures stay exactly the same
  - Legacy code requires zero modifications
- **New Planned API:** `IStepExecutor.LaunchAsync(config)` introduced in Phase 1
  - New interface for internal refactoring
  - Existing methods will delegate to this internally in Phase 2
- **Result Models:** Extended with optional fields (AssertionResults, ExtractedVariables)
  - Old code ignores new fields automatically
  - New code can use them for advanced features

#### Level 3: Runtime Behavior Compatibility
- **Simple Case:** Old YAML with no assertions → behaves exactly like before
- **New Case:** New YAML with assertions → validates and fails if assertions fail
- **Mixed:** Sequential pipeline → respects both old and new style tasks

---

## Core Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Optional Features & Alias Support

**Every new feature is optional, and schema supports multiple naming conventions:**
```yaml
# Canonical form (recommended)
steps:
  - path: "app.exe"
    arguments: "--version"

# Alternative: tasks (preferred for test-framework context)
tasks:
  - path: "app.exe"
    arguments: "--version"
    expectedReturnCode: 0
    assertions:
      - type: "output_contains"
        value: "Version"

# Alternative: apps (preferred for nb context)
apps:
  - path: "app.exe"
    arguments: "--version"
```

**All three forms (`steps`, `tasks`, `apps`) are equivalent and parse to the same internal model.**

**Why?** Allows gradual adoption. Teams can migrate at their own pace.

### Decision 2: Extracted Variables as Dictionary

**Variables flow via execution context:**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: "step1"
    path: "get-version.exe"
    extractVariables:
      - name: "my_version"
        pattern: "Version: (.+)"
        groupIndex: 1
  
  - name: "step2"
    path: "install.exe"
    arguments: "--version $(my_version)"  # Uses extracted value
    dependencies: ["step1"]
```

**Why?** Simple, testable, works for both sequential and parallel with proper ordering.

### Decision 3: Assertion Types Match test-framework

**Assertion types reuse test-framework's proven approach:**
- `output_contains` - Substring search
- `output_not_contains` - Negative assertion
- `output_matches` - Regex pattern
- `exit_code` - Return code validation
- `file_exists` - File presence check
- `custom_json` - JSONPath validation

**Why?** Test-framework already has well-designed, battle-tested assertion types. No need to reinvent.

### Decision 4: Dependency Resolution via Names

**Steps reference dependencies by name (not step number):**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: "download"
    path: "downloader.exe"
  
  - name: "install"
    dependencies: ["download"]  # By name, not index
    path: "installer.exe"
```

**Why?** Easier to reorder, comment out, or insert steps without breaking references.

### Decision 5: Sequential is Default Mode

**Default execution: sequential with dependency ordering:**
```yaml
# No explicit dependencies needed
steps:
  - path: "step1.exe"
  - path: "step2.exe"
  - path: "step3.exe"
```

**Why?** Matches test-framework behavior (steps numbered 1, 2, 3...). Explicit dependencies required only for complex ordering.

---

## YAML Schema Extensions

### Minimal Change (Most Backward Compatible)

```yaml
version: "1.0"  # Already required

# Canonical form
steps:
  - path: "app.exe"
    # Add these optional properties:
    expectedReturnCode: 0          # NEW
    assertions: []                  # NEW
    extractVariables: []            # NEW

# Also valid (test-framework context)
tasks:
  - path: "app.exe"
    expectedReturnCode: 0

# Also valid (nb context)
apps:
  - path: "app.exe"
    expectedReturnCode: 0
```

### What Stays Unchanged
- `path`, `arguments`, `workingDirectory`, `timeout` properties
- `environment` variable handling
- `verifySignature` digital signature verification
- `dependencies` ordering (already in schema)
- Parallel/sequential execution modes

### What Gets Added
- `expectedReturnCode` - Alternative to implicit 0 assumption
- `assertions` - Output validation rules
- `extractVariables` - Regex-based output capture

## Test-Framework Compatibility

### Current test-framework Pattern
```yaml
# test-framework metadata format
commands:
  - step: 1
    name: "Get version"
    command: "app.exe"
    args: ["--version"]
    expected_exit_code: 0
    variable_extractions:
      - name: "version"
        pattern: "Version: (\\d+)"
        group_index: 1
    assertions:
      - type: "output_contains"
        value: "Version"
```

### Equivalent YAML Launcher Format
```yaml
# YAML launcher format (unified)
# Note: Can also use 'tasks:' or 'apps:' - all equivalent
steps:
  - name: "Get version"
    path: "app.exe"
    arguments: "--version"
    expectedReturnCode: 0
    extractVariables:
      - name: "version"
        pattern: "Version: (\\d+)"
        groupIndex: 1
    assertions:
      - type: "output_contains"
        value: "Version"
```

**Migration:** Minimal - just rename properties (snake_case → camelCase).

---

## nb Command Compatibility

### Current nb Pattern (to migrate)
```bash
nb install --json tools.json        # Current: JSON manifest (deprecated)
nb install --name MyApp             # Install from default location
nb list                             # List available apps
```

### New Unified YAML Format
```yaml
# Simple case: Single step
step:
  path: "sdo.exe"
  arguments: "install --name MyApp"

# Complex deployments: Multi-step orchestration
steps:  # Canonical form; can also use 'tasks' or 'apps'
  - name: "download"
    path: "downloader.exe"
    arguments: "--version 1.0.0"
  
  - name: "install"
    path: "installer.exe"
    dependencies: ["download"]
    expectedReturnCode: 0
    assertions:
      - type: "output_contains"
        value: "Installation complete"
```

**Unified Approach:**
1. **YAML is the single standard format** across all three repositories
2. **Auto-conversion tooling provided** to migrate existing JSON manifests to YAML
3. **Phase 1:** Implement YAML launcher with nb support
4. **Phase 2:** Provide `json-to-yaml` migration utility
5. **Phase 3:** Gradually deprecate JSON format (keep read support for backward compat)
6. **Result:** All three repos speak same language (YAML), simpler maintenance

---

## ntools-launcher Compatibility

### Current Process-Based Pattern
```csharp
var process = new Process { StartInfo = ... };
process.LockVerifyStart(verbose: true);  // Existing API
```

### New YAML-Based Pattern
```csharp
var executor = new StepExecutor();
var result = await executor.LaunchAsync("deploy.yaml");  // New API
```

### Compatibility Guarantee
```csharp
// This continues to work forever (unchanged)
process.LockVerifyStart(verbose: true);

// This also works (new parallel API)
await launcher.LaunchAsync("deploy.yaml");

// Both approaches coexist in same codebase
```

**Migration:** Optional. Teams can adopt YAML gradually while keeping existing code.

---

## Assertion Types

### Type: output_contains
```yaml
assertions:
  - type: "output_contains"
    value: "Success"
    caseInsensitive: false
```
Checks if stdout contains substring.

### Type: output_not_contains
```yaml
assertions:
  - type: "output_not_contains"
    value: "Error"
    caseInsensitive: true
```
Checks that stdout does NOT contain substring.

### Type: output_matches
```yaml
assertions:
  - type: "output_matches"
    pattern: "^Completed in \\d+ ms$"
```
Checks stdout against regex pattern.

### Type: exit_code
```yaml
assertions:
  - type: "exit_code"
    value: 0
```
Validates process exit code (redundant with expectedReturnCode, but explicit).

### Type: file_exists
```yaml
assertions:
  - type: "file_exists"
    value: "$(InstallPath)\\app.exe"
```
Checks file exists on disk (supports variable substitution).

### Type: custom_json
```yaml
assertions:
  - type: "custom_json"
    jsonPath: "$.status"
    expectedValue: "success"
```
Parses JSON output and validates with JSONPath.

## Error Messages & Diagnostics

### Assertion Failure Example
```
❌ Task 'install' failed
   Expected return code: 0
   Actual return code: 1
   
   Assertion 1 FAILED: output_contains
   Expected substring: "Installation complete"
   
   Actual output (first 500 chars):
   ─────────────────────────────────────────
   Preparing installation...
   Error: Insufficient permissions
   ─────────────────────────────────────────
   
   Suggestion: Run installer with elevated privileges
```

### Variable Extraction Failure
```
⚠️  Task 'extract-version' warning
   Variable extraction: version
   Pattern: Version: (\d+\.\d+\.\d+)
   
   Pattern did not match output
   Output searched:
   ─────────────────────────────────────────
   Usage: app --help
   ─────────────────────────────────────────
   
   Note: Variable not extracted, skipping dependent tasks
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Breaking Changes
**Mitigation:** All new properties optional. Existing code path unchanged.
- Old YAML → works exactly as before
- New YAML → opt-in new features
- Legacy APIs → remain unchanged

### Risk 2: Performance Regression
**Mitigation:** No additional overhead for simple case (no assertions).
- Assertion validation only if assertions specified
- Variable extraction only if extractVariables specified
- Benchmarking in Phase 4 to validate overhead < 5%

### Risk 3: Adoption Barrier
**Mitigation:** Gradual migration path.
- Phase 1: Just core functionality (no assertions needed)
- Phase 2: Integration (legacy code continues)
- Phase 3-5: Optional advanced features

### Risk 4: Complex Dependency Graphs
**Mitigation:** DependencyResolver validates DAG before execution.
- Circular dependency detection
- Missing dependency errors
- Clear error messages

## Questions & Answers

### Q: How is this different from test-framework's metadata?
**A:** This unifies test-framework's approach with nb's and ntools-launcher's patterns. Test-framework has assertions/extraction; this extends those to all three codebases.

### Q: Will existing test-framework tests still work?
**A:** Yes. Can coexist. MetadataTestExecutor can be compatibility layer or gradually migrated to StepExecutor.

### Q: What about nb commands that don't fit this pattern?
**A:** Those continue using `nb install --name MyApp`. YAML launcher is for complex orchestrations, not simple cases.

### Q: Do I have to rewrite my code?
**A:** No. All existing code continues to work. YAML launcher is additive, not replacement.

### Q: What about $(variable) conflicts with environment variables?
**A:** Precedence: Extracted variables > Environment variables > Predefined variables. Explicit rules prevent conflicts.

### Q: Can I use this without assertions?
**A:** Absolutely. Assertions are completely optional. YAML launcher works fine for simple execution.

## Rolling Adoption Strategy: Unified Single Design Across All Repositories

### Final Goal: Single YAML Launcher Framework

This design **enables complete replacement** of existing code in all three repositories with the unified YAML launcher approach. The final requirement is:

> **Within 6 months: All executable orchestration across ntools-launcher, nb, and test-framework uses the single YAML launcher framework.**

---

### Phase Breakdown: Replacing Legacy Code

#### Phase 1-2: ntools-launcher Transition (Weeks 1-4)
**Current State:** Process.LockVerifyStart() and manual orchestration in C#

**Transition Strategy:**
1. **Week 1-2 (Foundation):** New YAML launcher deployed alongside existing code
   - Existing: `process.LockVerifyStart(verbose)` continues to work
   - New: `await launcher.LaunchAsync("deployment.yaml")` available
   - Status: **Coexistence**

2. **Week 2-4 (Integration & Refactoring):**
   - All internal ntools-launcher orchestrations migrated to YAML
   - Launcher.cs refactored to use new framework internally
   - External API remains unchanged (backward compatible)
   - Status: **Internal Migration Complete**

3. **Post-Week 4 (Documentation):**
   - Deprecation notice: Process-based approach marked for removal in v2.0
   - Migration guide provided for external users
   - New projects default to YAML approach
   - Status: **Legacy Path Documented**

**Requirement:** By end of Week 4, 100% of ntools-launcher's new functionality uses YAML launcher.

---

#### Phase 2-3: nb Integration (Weeks 2-6)
**Current State:** JSON manifest for simple installs, no complex orchestration

**Transition Strategy:**
1. **Week 2-3:** YAML launcher deployed for nb with migration tooling
   - New: `nb install --yaml deployment.yaml` command added
   - Tooling: `nb migrate --json-to-yaml tools.json` converts JSON manifests to YAML
   - Old: `nb install --json tools.json` still works (internally uses YAML after conversion)
   - Status: **Single Format Foundation**

2. **Week 3-4:** All complex deployments use YAML
   - Multi-step deployments (download, verify, install, register) use YAML
   - Simple single-app installs can still use JSON (auto-converted)
   - Status: **Unified Internal Format**

3. **Week 5-6:** JSON becomes optional/legacy
   - JSON files automatically converted to YAML at read time
   - `nb install --json tools.json` transparently converts to YAML
   - Users see no change; implementation unified on YAML
   - Status: **Transparent YAML Foundation**

4. **Post-Week 6:** YAML is primary format
   - Deprecation: JSON input marked for v2.0 removal
   - Migration guide provided for all JSON users
   - New nb features only support YAML
   - Status: **Pure YAML Format**

**Requirement:** By end of Week 6, all nb configurations standardized on YAML launcher (with backward-compatible JSON-to-YAML conversion).

---

#### Phase 3-4: test-framework Integration (Weeks 3-8)
**Current State:** Separate MetadataTestExecutor with assertions and extraction

**Transition Strategy:**
1. **Week 3-4:** Compatibility layer established
   - MetadataTestExecutor delegates to StepExecutor
   - Existing test-framework YAML continues to work
   - Behind the scenes: Using new framework
   - Status: **Invisible Migration**

2. **Week 4-6:** New test scenarios use unified schema
   - New tests written in unified YAML format
   - Old tests migrated gradually as maintained
   - Property name migration: snake_case → camelCase
   - Status: **Mixed Mode**

3. **Week 6-8:** Complete consolidation
   - All test-framework scenarios use unified schema
   - MetadataTestExecutor becomes thin wrapper
   - Single assertion/extraction engine across framework
   - Status: **Engine Consolidated**

4. **Post-Week 8:** Pure YAML framework
   - Deprecation: MetadataTestExecutor marked as legacy
   - New tests use StepExecutor directly
   - Status: **Single Framework**

**Requirement:** By end of Week 8, all test-framework test scenarios use unified YAML launcher.

### Code Replacement Examples

#### ntools-launcher: From Process API to YAML

**Before (Current):**
```csharp
public async Task DeployAsync()
{
    var downloader = new Process { StartInfo = ... };
    downloader.LockVerifyStart(verbose: true);
    
    var installer = new Process { StartInfo = ... };
    installer.LockVerifyStart(verbose: true);
    
    var verifier = new Process { StartInfo = ... };
    verifier.LockVerifyStart(verbose: true);
}
```

**After (Unified YAML):**
```csharp
public async Task DeployAsync()
{
    var executor = new StepExecutor();
    var result = await executor.LaunchAsync("deploy.yaml");
    
    if (!result.Success)
        throw new DeploymentException(result.ErrorMessage);
}
```

**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
version: "1.0"
steps:  # Or use 'tasks' for test context or 'apps' for deployment
  - name: "download"
    path: "downloader.exe"
    verifySignature: true
    expectedReturnCode: 0
  
  - name: "install"
    path: "installer.exe"
    verifySignature: true
    dependencies: ["download"]
    expectedReturnCode: 0
  
  - name: "verify"
    path: "verifier.exe"
    dependencies: ["install"]
    expectedReturnCode: 0
```

**Result:** 15 lines of C# code → 3 lines of C# code + declarative YAML

---

#### nb: From JSON to Unified YAML

**Before (Current):**
```json
{
  "Name": "MyApp",
  "InstallCommand": "powershell.exe",
  "InstallArgs": "-Command Expand-Archive..."
}
```

**After (Transparent):**
```bash
nb install --yaml myapp-deployment.yaml
# Internally: JSON auto-converted or YAML directly used
```

**YAML Equivalent:**
```yaml
version: "1.0"
steps:  # Can also use 'tasks' or 'apps'
  - name: "download-release"
    path: "gh.exe"
    arguments: "release download..."
    expectedReturnCode: 0
  
  - name: "extract"
    path: "powershell.exe"
    arguments: "-Command Expand-Archive..."
    dependencies: ["download-release"]
```

**Result:** Isolated commands → Multi-step orchestration

---

#### test-framework: From Metadata to Unified

**Before (Current):**
```yaml
# test-framework metadata format
commands:
  - step: 1
    command: "sdo.exe"
    args: ["wi", "list", "--json"]
    variable_extractions:
      - name: "id"
        pattern: '"id":\s*(\d+)'
```

**After (Unified):**
```yaml
# YAML launcher format (same capabilities)
steps:  # Canonical form
  - name: "list-items"
    path: "sdo.exe"
    arguments: "wi list --json"
    extractVariables:
      - name: "id"
        pattern: '"id":\s*(\d+)'
```

**Result:** Separate framework → Part of unified ecosystem

### Single Design Requirements

#### Requirement 1: Complete Code Replacement Capability ✅
**Status:** Design enables this
- All features from three codebases supported in YAML launcher
- Legacy code can be removed without functionality loss
- New code can be written entirely in YAML

#### Requirement 2: Backward Compatibility During Transition ✅
**Status:** Design guarantees this
- Old code runs alongside new code
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- Gradual migration path for each repo

#### Requirement 3: Single Unified Framework ✅
**Status:** Design achieves this
- One YAML schema for all three repos
- Single assertion engine
- Single extraction engine
- Single orchestration engine

#### Requirement 4: Cross-Repository Orchestration ✅
**Status:** Design supports this
- Can orchestrate nb → test-framework scenarios
- Can orchestrate test-framework → ntools-launcher deployments
- Variables flow across repository boundaries

#### Requirement 5: Simplified Codebase Maintenance ✅
**Status:** Design reduces duplication
- One assertion validator (not three)
- One variable extractor (not two)
- One orchestration engine (not three different approaches)
- One documentation set covering all use cases
