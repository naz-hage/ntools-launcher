## ✅ Design Completeness Checklist

### Requirements Met ✅
- Unifies test-framework, nb, ntools-launcher patterns
- Maintains 100% backward compatibility
- Supports output assertions (test-framework pattern)
- Supports variable extraction (test-framework pattern)
- Supports variable passing (test-framework pattern)
- Supports return code validation (nb pattern)
- Supports digital signatures (ntools-launcher pattern)
- Supports sequential pipelines
- Supports parallel execution

### Documentation Complete ✅
- Complete YAML schema specified
- C# API interfaces designed
- Model classes specified
- 5 phases of implementation planned
- Assertion types defined
- Variable extraction patterns explained
- Real-world examples provided (5+)
- Migration paths documented
- Architectural decisions recorded
- Risk mitigation planned

### Testing Strategy Defined ✅
- Unit tests per phase
- Integration tests per phase
- E2E tests with real executables
- Performance benchmarks
- Backward compatibility tests

---

## 🎯 Key Highlights

### Test-Framework Integration ⭐
- **Optional assertions:** `output_contains`, `output_matches`, `output_equals`, `exit_code`, `file_exists`, `custom_json`
- **Variable extraction:** Regex-based patterns with capture groups
- **Variable passing:** Automatic `$(variable)` substitution in arguments
- **Full backward compatibility:** All existing test-framework code continues to work

### Schema Design Philosophy
1. **All new features optional** - Existing YAML works unchanged
2. **Simple default case** - Just `path` and `arguments` for basic execution
3. **Opt-in advanced features** - Add `assertions` and `extractVariables` as needed
4. **Consistent with test-framework** - Uses proven patterns from production

### Unified Framework Benefits
```
Before (3 separate approaches):
  - test-framework: assertions + extraction
  - nb: return codes + JSON
  - ntools-launcher: signatures + orchestration

After (1 unified approach):
  - YAML Launcher: all of the above + more
  - Single YAML syntax
  - Single error handling
  - Single variable flow
```

## 📈 Impact Summary

### Before (Current State)
- 3 separate execution models across 3 repos
- Duplicated logic for assertions, error handling, result passing
- No unified way to orchestrate cross-repository workflows
- test-framework capabilities not available in nb or ntools-launcher

### After (With YAML Launcher)
- 1 unified execution model across all repos
- Shared assertion, validation, and error handling engine
- Orchestrate complex multi-step deployments in single YAML file
- All capabilities (assertions, extraction, verification) available everywhere
