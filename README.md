## Introduction
This repository contains a .NET Core class library that wraps around the .NET class Process. It provides a `ResultHelper` class that returns the code and output of the launcher executable. The library is used by the ntools `Nbackup` program to launch `robocopy` and wait for it to complete, ensuring that the backup process is fully completed before the program continues.
